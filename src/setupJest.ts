Comment out the line below to run tests via a Jest test runner extension via VS Code.
This is because the test runner needs to initialise with jest-preset-angular, but the
@angular-builders/jest runner in angular.json already does this.

This line _must_ remain commented out though when building via the npm run test command,
especially when building via Jenkins CI.
