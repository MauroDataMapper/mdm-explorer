    <h1>Mauro Data Explorer: Request Data</h1>
    <p>
      The Mauro Data Explorer has been created as a simplified version of our well
      established Mauro Data Mapper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will allow you to focus on finding and requesting the data that is relevant for
      your research and, if you are interested, to see what other data there is that could
      add value.
