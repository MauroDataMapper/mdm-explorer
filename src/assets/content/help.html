    The Oxford University Mauro Explorer allows researchers to explore and request data
    from the OUH Clinical Data Warehouse. Registered researchers can browse and search for
    data items, submit a request for items of interest, and, pending governance approval,
    gain access to the data within our secure Trusted Research Environment.

    <h2>Browsing our data assets</h2>
    <p>
      In Mauro Data Explorer, there are two ways to find the data that you need. The first
      is browsing - this gives you an overview of all of our 'modules' and lets you drill
      down into its structure to find the data that you need.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row content">
    <div class="column">
      <p>
        The left-hand side of the browse screen shows the top-level <em>modules</em> that
        we hold. These correspond to areas of interest within our data warehouse - for
        example <em>Demographics</em> information, or details of
        <em>Laboratory Tests</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you choose a module in the left-hand side, the right-hand side shows a list
        of <em>sub-modules</em> - sub-categories of data within that module. The data may
        be split by source system or disease area - for example
        <em>Demographics</em> information is split into feeds from <em>ARIA</em>, and
        <em>ORBIT</em>. Alternatively, the data is split into smaller areas of treatment -
        for example <em>Hospital Events</em> data is further split into details relating
        to <em>Inpatient events</em> and <em>Outpatient events</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing a second-level category allows you to browse the individual data elements
        within it. These are displayed on a new page and you can apply filters to further
        restrict the item list in order to find what you are looking for.
      </p>

    <h2>Searching</h2>
    <p>
      If you know the kind of data that you require, you might alternatively begin by
      searching for it.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row content">
    <p>
      Our keyword-based search allows you to search for particular data elements of
      interest. The search bar allows you to search for particular phrases or combinations
      of keywords using some standard searching operators. For example, search for
      outpatient operation details using <em>outpatient + operation</em>. Exclude results
      using the <em>-</em> symbol, and use quotes to search for a particular phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have some search results, you can further filter those to find the items of
      interest. Filters are based on properties of the data elements, such as the source
      system, the terminology used to record values, or the sector of care in which this
      data element is collected.
    </p>

    <h2>Data specifications</h2>
    <p>
      Create a new data specification and add items to it - submit the data specification
      to apply to be given access to those items in our secure research environment.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row content">
    <p>
      While you are browsing our data assets, you can curate one or more data
      specifications which will begin the application process to receive data. Create a
      data specification by giving it a name and a description - tell us more about why
      you want the data. If you've not already done so, you may wish to
      <a>Contact us</a> to discuss your plans with us in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add a data element to a draft data specification at any time - and view your
      data specifications using the menu bar at the top. You can maintain multiple data
      specifications simultaneously, and add a data element to several data specifications
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also <em>Bookmark</em> items for consideration later on - this doesn't add
      them to a data specification, but stores them so that you may find them later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have finished adding items to your data specification, you can
      <em>Submit</em> the data specification. This will finalise it - you will no-longer
      be able to add or remove items from it - and it will be passed to our data
      management team for processing. Submitted data specifications are passed through a
      governance process, and once access is confirmed, you will be sent details of how to
      securely access your data inside our Trusted Research Environment (TRE).
